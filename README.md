Modular-PircBot
===============

An extension of PircBot (http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php/) that offers a framework
in which you can add your own modules.

Some basic and "not that basic" modules are provided in the modular-pirbot-modules
project. You can use one, several or all modules in your own bot, depending on your
needs. As a starting point, you may want to give a look at the AuthMode,
JoinOnServerResponse and Quit modules.

This project is fully documented; you should give a close look to the provided
modules to understand how they work. Please check the <a href="wiki">wiki</a> for additional
information.
