Modular-PircBot
===============

An extension of PircBot (http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php/) that offers a framework
in which you can add your own modules.

Some basic and "not that basic" modules are provided in the modular-pirbot-modules
project. You can use one, several or all modules in your own bot, depending on your
needs. As a starting point, you may want to give a look at the AuthMode,
JoinOnServerResponse and Quit modules.

This project is still under active development; documentation of code will come as
it approaches the first release.
