Extended-PircBotX
=================

An extension of PircBotX (https://code.google.com/p/pircbotx/) that offers an extended
bot with runnable and triggerable listeners support.

Some basic and "not that basic" listeners are provided in the extended-pirbotx-modules
project. You can use one, several or all listeners in your own bot, depending on your
needs. As a starting point, you may want to give a look at the AuthModeListener,
JoinOnServerResponseListener and QuitListener modules.

This project is fully documented; you should give a close look to the provided
listeners to understand how they work. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/Bhasmithal/Extended-PircBotX/wiki/">wiki</a> for additional
information.
